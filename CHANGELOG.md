dates.

## Unreleased

## 0.1.3 - 2026-08-09

- Added: Optional bounded `focus` and repository-relative `path` signals plus a deterministic
  per-source AGENTS selection audit in Markdown and JSON output.
- Changed: Root `AGENTS.md` loading now combines a 4-KiB head, relevant complete Markdown sections,
  parent context, and an indexed-only heading fallback without increasing the 16-KiB output budget.
- Added: A tag-only Gitea Actions workflow with exact checkout, version and package verification,
  wheel and sdist builds, SHA-256 checksums, and refusal to overwrite an existing Release.
- Changed: Changelog validation now requires one non-empty section for the source version, and
  Gitea Release notes are extracted from that exact section.
- Release status: Released from annotated tag `v0.1.3`; its tag-triggered workflow creates the
  Gitea Release and verified package artifacts.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-08-01

- Added: The stable JSON output contract with source provenance and SHA-256 values while preserving
  the existing Markdown output.
- Changed: JSON mode accepts an absolute path inside a worktree and reports the canonical Git root.
- Release status: Tagged as `v0.1.2`.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-20

- Fixed: Report a configured upstream even when its commit is not yet locally resolvable, as in a
  clone of an empty remote.
- Release status: Tagged as `v0.1.1`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-19

- Added: Deterministic, bounded local Git context collection and the `codex-project-context` CLI.
- Release status: Tagged as `v0.1.0`.
